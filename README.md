## Problem Domain:

Phase 1 Requirements
From a business requirements standpoint, we will be building a basic Express server using best practices, including server modularization, use of middleware, and tests.

Person Route
Method: GET
Path: /person
Expects a query string from the user with a “name” property
When present, output JSON to the client with this shape: { name: "name provided" }
Without a name in the query string, force a “500” error
